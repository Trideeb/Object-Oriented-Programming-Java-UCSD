# Project Description:

- An interactive graphical map which displays all the major earthquakes that have occurred with data collected from the website (link: https://www.usgs.gov/) 
- For drawing out the Map, I chose

1. Google Maps as my Maps Provider
2. Unfolding library for setting up and drawing out the basic layout of the Map. [http://unfoldingmaps.org/](url)
3. Processing library to draw shapes. [https://processing.org/reference/libraries/](url)
